# extend_tv

Initial Description and Link:
I extended Ariana Nolans tidyverse example (https://github.com/acatlin/FALL2022TIDYVERSE/pull/12) with additional code. 

I extended the example by further looking at multiple other functions from dplyr package such as arrange and mutate. Furthermore, I also used tidyr package in tidyverse to convert data from long to wide.

My extend assignment output is published at: https://rpubs.com/khyatinaik9/extend_tv
My extend assignment code is saved at: https://github.com/Naik-Khyati/extend_tv/blob/main/code/607_extend_tv.Rmd
